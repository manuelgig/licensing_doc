We obtained deal, contracts and patent lists from BiosciDB.

Deals
#####

Deal data covers 9,197 deals in the pharmaceutical sector.
Each deals is uniquely identified. Among other elements, deal data includes:

* Deal size (in $M)
* Deal dates
* Deal type (e.g., license, research, co-development, termination,
  distribution, etc.)
* Contract type (e.g., license, joint venture, option, equity, etc.)
* Name and type of parties (e.g., major biotech, top pharma, mid-tier pharma,
  etc.)
* Financial data (upfront payment, fees, equity, milestones, royalties, etc.)
* Drug data: compound name, molecular target, indication, development stage,
  technology,
* Territory

Contracts
#########

Raw contract data consists of 3802 pdf files. We could not extract the text
from 19 contracts for different reasons (e.g., they are scanned images instead
of text, they contain mostly transcription errors, etc.). We parsed the remaining
contracts using machine learning and NLP techniques, so that for each contract
we have:

* the clauses, as separated pieces of text;
* clause titles,
* clause hierarchy: we sorted the classes into nested hierarchical levels using
  clause indices, e.g. the clause "5. Payment [...]" contains "5.1. Royalties
  [...]" and "5.2 Upfront fees [...]";
* clause labels: we classified clauses into ~40 different types (e.g.,
  definitions, payment, responsibility, termination, etc.)
* named entities: we used NER tools to extract from each clause dates, durations,
  money amounts, addresses, organization names, trademarks, and geolocations
* patent: we developed a script to recognize and extract patent numbers
  (applications and grants) from raw text, and applied it to identify patent
  numbers *within* the contract text.

Moreover, we organize the database in such a way that it is ready to perform
text analysis at the clause level.

We could link 3797 contracts with machine-readable text (i.e., that we could
extract, not images) to deals.

patent lists
########

Raw patent list data consists of 3776 pdf files with lists of patents. Most patent list
files are appendices or exhibits from a contract.

  The relationships between deals, contracts and patent lists are somewhat complex
  (one to many, many to one, deals without contracts, deals with patent list only,
  patent lists not matched to deal or contract, etc.). The database includes
  tables to facilitate working with these elements (e.g., src.deal_file_link,
  src.file_info, etc.)
