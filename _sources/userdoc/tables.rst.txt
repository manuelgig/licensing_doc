Description of tables
=====================

The tables of the database are grouped in three schemas:

* *log:* tables that log when and how the different preprocessing and parsing
  tasks took place
* *deal:* tables that record deal data
* *src:* tables with data extracted from the pdf files (contracts, ip lists),
  data derived from them (sections, section labels, NER), and other tables
  such as focal company names and ownership structure.
