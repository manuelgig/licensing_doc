########################
The *licensing* database
########################

.. admonition:: Note

  This documentation is under construction


This database contains rich, detailed information from a large set of
pharma licensing contracts, including:

* Contract contents parsed and segmented into sections (clauses), ready to perform
  text-based analysis
* Sections titles and labels
* NER and content extraction: firms, organizations, universities, dates,
  amounts, etc.
* Patent data: patents listed in the contracts and exhibits

The database also includes data from the licensing deals that originated the
contracts: parties, deal type, deal subject, deal size, dates, territory,
technology, indication(s), molecular target(s), etc. We obtained the raw data
from BiosciDB, and used extensive scripting, machine learning and large language
models to build the database.
